Installation of:

* Machinekit

=== Usage

in a 1st terminal run
```
halrun -I ~/ros_catkin_ws/src/ros_hello_machinekit/halfile.hal
```

in a 2nd terminal rin
```
roscore
```

in a 3nd terminal run
```
rosrun ros_hello_machinekit hello_world_publisher.py
```

in a 4rd terminal run
```
rosrun ros_hello_machinekit hello_world_subscriber.py
```

return to the first terminal
```
show comp
show pin
```

you'll notice the subscriber has the value of `0`. Thaty's because the pin `rospub-inside-HAL.value-in` is still `0`

type:
```
net cosine siggen.0.cosine rospub-inside-HAL.value-in
```

see that the subscriber now gets the values of the `siggen.0.cosine` pin from `siggen`
